For this assignment, you develop a turn-based game where you control a blue turtle, Alex, to chase and catch a red turtle, Alice. Create a canvas (also known as screen) of size 500 x 500. Alex must appear at the middle of the canvas. Alice appears at a random location inside the canvas.
In each turn, Alice can move either forward by 20 pixels or she can change her direction randomly to left or right by 90 degrees. 2/3 of Alice’s movements should be forward movements and 1/3 should be the random direction changing left or right, see figure 1 below.
Alex moves as directed by the player using the keyboard. In each turn, the buttons w, a, s, and d lead Alex to move forward for 30 pixels, turn left for 45 degrees, back for 30 pixels, and right for 45 degrees, respectively. If Alex or Alice cross the canvas’s boundaries, they should reappear at a random1 location on the canvas. The game statistic needs to be provided on the screen as shown in the sample. The game ends if Alex comes within 30 pixels of Alice in any direction. See figure 2 to get an idea of how the game will look like.
